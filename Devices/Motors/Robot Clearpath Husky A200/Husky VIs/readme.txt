This LabVIEW distribution is meant to serve as a framework for building control 
software for Clearpath Robotics platforms with integrated National Instruments
hardware. It implements a subset of the Clearpath Control Protocol and will be
expanded accordingly as more Clearpath Robotics products integrate National
Instruments hardware.

It is currently tested with LabVIEW 9.0.1 and LabVIEW 10. It has been run on 
the cRIO-9022, cRIO-9024, and the sbRIO-9631. A C++ library (cwrap_cRIO.out)
must reside on the target, in the ni-rt/system directory. For more details about 
this library, contact your Clearpath Robotics representative or email
skynet@clearpathrobotics.com.

The included sample project demonstrates simple teleoperation over a wired or
wireless network.
